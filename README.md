## 📖 Story Behind the Code *(The Morocco Arc)*

This app was built during my stay in Morocco after I **broke my main laptop** mid-way through development 😭. With barely any time left, I switched to a backup PC and literally started over.

Due to my limited environment and stress, I had to use **some paid libraries** (like fingerprint scanner) just to keep moving. Each part of this app was built through sleepless nights, deep frustration, and mental fatigue — but I finished it.

This is my real code, from scratch, under fire. 💯

## 👨‍💻 Built With Grit

Everything you see in this repo — UI, sensors, calorie diary, navigation, timer, fingerprint BPM, and FitBot’s foundation — was **written, fixed, and polished** by me:

## 🧠 FitBot – AI Coach *(in progress)*

The groundwork for a virtual AI fitness coach has been added. Once hooked into a free LLM API, users will be able to:

- Ask questions like:  
  “How can I grow my chest faster?”  
  “What’s a good leg-day plan?”  
  “What protein foods are low-calorie?”

- And receive motivational or educational replies from **FitBot**.
